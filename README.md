# MyMinecraft
I endeavored to develop a Minecraft-inspired game with the primary goal of comprehending the underlying mechanics and logic intrinsic to the gameplay. This undertaking involved exploring various aspects, including block-breaking mechanisms, construction methodologies for building diverse structures, character actions such as jumping and running, among other relevant functionalities.
